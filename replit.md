# Spell Ring Manager

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application for managing a D&D spell library and ring storage system. The application allows users to upload spells via CSV files, browse through a spell library, and manage a personal spell ring with capacity limitations. Built with React frontend, Express backend, and PostgreSQL database using Drizzle ORM.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **File Upload**: Multer for handling CSV uploads
- **CSV Processing**: PapaParse for parsing CSV files
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL store

### Database Schema
- **spells**: Stores spell information (id, name, class, level, description)
- **ring_storage**: Manages spells in user's ring (id, spell_id, added_at)
- **users**: User management (id, username, password)

## Key Components

### Core Features
1. **CSV Upload System**: Allows bulk importing of spells from CSV files
2. **Spell Library**: Browsable collection with filtering by class, level, and search
3. **Ring Management**: Personal spell storage with capacity tracking
4. **Capacity Visualization**: Visual indicators for ring capacity and usage

### Frontend Components
- **SpellCard**: Reusable component for displaying spells in library and ring views
- **CapacityIndicator**: Visual representation of ring capacity and usage
- **File Upload**: Drag-and-drop CSV upload interface

### Backend Services
- **Storage Layer**: Abstracted storage interface with in-memory implementation
- **CSV Processing**: Validates and processes uploaded spell data
- **API Routes**: RESTful endpoints for spell and ring management

## Data Flow

1. **CSV Upload**: User uploads CSV → Backend processes and validates → Stores in database
2. **Spell Library**: Frontend queries spells → Backend retrieves from database → Displays with filters
3. **Ring Management**: User adds/removes spells → Backend updates ring storage → Frontend reflects changes
4. **Capacity Tracking**: Ring additions check capacity limits → Prevents overflow → Updates UI indicators

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: PostgreSQL database connection
- **drizzle-orm**: Type-safe database queries and migrations
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management
- **@radix-ui/***: Accessible UI primitives
- **tailwindcss**: Utility-first CSS framework

### File Processing
- **multer**: Multipart form handling for file uploads
- **papaparse**: CSV parsing and validation

### Development Tools
- **vite**: Build tool and development server
- **tsx**: TypeScript execution for development
- **esbuild**: Production bundling

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
- Frontend: Vite builds React app to `dist/public`
- Backend: esbuild bundles Express server to `dist/index.js`
- Database: Drizzle migrations in `migrations/` directory

### Environment Configuration
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string (required)
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment mode (development/production)

### Scripts
- `dev`: Development server with hot reloading
- `build`: Production build for both frontend and backend
- `start`: Production server startup
- `db:push`: Apply database schema changes

# How to Download Your Project from Replit

## Method 1: Using Replit's Download Feature

### Option A: Three Dots Menu
1. **Look for the three dots (â‹¯)** in the top-right corner of your Replit interface
2. **Click the menu** and look for:
   - "Download as ZIP"
   - "Export"
   - "Download project"

### Option B: File Menu
1. **Click "File"** in the top menu bar
2. **Look for:**
   - "Download as ZIP"
   - "Export project"

### Option C: Right-click in File Explorer
1. **Right-click on your project name** in the file explorer (left panel)
2. **Look for download or export options**

## Method 2: Alternative - Use Git Clone

If you can't find the download button, you can clone your project:

1. **Get your Replit Git URL:**
   - Look for a "Version Control" or "Git" tab
   - Copy the clone URL (usually looks like: `https://github.com/replit/your-project-name.git`)

2. **Clone locally** (if you have Git installed):
   ```bash
   git clone [your-replit-git-url]
   ```

## Method 3: Manual File Copy

If other methods don't work:

1. **Create a new folder** on your computer called `dnd-spell-manager`
2. **Copy each file individually:**
   - Open each file in Replit
   - Select all text (Ctrl+A / Cmd+A)
   - Copy (Ctrl+C / Cmd+C)
   - Create same file on your computer and paste

### Important Files to Copy:
- `package.json`
- `package-lock.json`
- All files in `client/` folder
- All files in `server/` folder
- All files in `shared/` folder
- `tsconfig.json`
- `vite.config.ts`
- `tailwind.config.ts`
- `drizzle.config.ts`
- `.gitignore`
- `README.md`
- `vercel.json`
- `.env.example`

## Method 4: Direct GitHub Upload (Easiest)

Skip downloading entirely and upload directly:

1. **Create GitHub repository** first
2. **In Replit:** Look for "Version Control" or "Git" features
3. **Connect to GitHub** and push directly
4. **Or manually upload files** one by one to GitHub web interface

## Troubleshooting

**Can't find download option?**
- Try refreshing the page
- Check if you're the owner of the Repl
- Look in different menu locations

**Download not working?**
- Try a different browser
- Check if popup blockers are enabled
- Use Method 3 (manual copy) as backup

**Still stuck?**
- We can set up Git directly in Replit
- Or copy files manually to GitHub
- Contact me and I'll help with alternative methods

The goal is to get your code to GitHub so we can deploy to Vercel - there are multiple ways to achieve this!
